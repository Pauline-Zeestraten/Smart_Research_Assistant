As part of my Generative AI and Business Applications course, I developed a Smart Article Insights Generator using transformer models such as FLAN-T5 (encoder-decoder) and TinyLlama (decoder-only).  

FLAN-T5 faced limitations with long texts, while TinyLlama handled targeted queries well despite its small size and causal nature.

This Streamlit interface enables users to summarize articles or extract specific insights, supporting better decision-making.
